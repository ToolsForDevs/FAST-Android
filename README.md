Demo project coming soon

Head over the wiki for more information or check out our website https://www.fast-sdk.com

Current status : **Beta**  
Last version : **0.8.7**

## What is FAST SDK?
FAST SDK is a framework of UI tools for Android developers.

In order to be compatible with and integrated in as many projects as possible, FAST SDK do not rely on the androidx (nor the old appcompat) libraries or any third party library. This way, we can ensure that there will be no dependency conflicts, and avoid upgrading dependencies if necessary.

FAST SDK is a framework. While one of the primary objective is to provide UI tools for Android developers, an equally important objective is to offer a way for Android developers to create their own tools quickly and simply.

*While we don’t provide any documentation for creating your own tools during the beta phase (as we’re focused on making the first batch of tools), it will be available once the public beta is over.*
